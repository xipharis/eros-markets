          <p>Each account has two terminal values: its value if the market resolves NO (<strong>E0</strong>) and its value if it resolves YES (<strong>E1</strong>). An account is <strong>fully backed</strong> when both are non-negative. A fully backed account cannot lose more than its collateral and is not subject to price-based liquidation.</p>
          <p>An account is <strong>leveraged</strong> when one terminal value is negative. That shortfall, the <em>deficit</em>, is covered by the market&apos;s <Link href="/docs/reserve">reserve</Link>. Leveraged accounts pay a <Link href="/docs/funding#premium">jump premium</Link> to the reserve and are subject to margin requirements.</p>
