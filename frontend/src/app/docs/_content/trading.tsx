          <p>For a new position, the ticket provides a leverage selector from 1× up to the market&apos;s current cap. Leverage above 1× requires a live mark. The ticket computes the collateral the order needs at the chosen leverage, adding a 1% buffer for leveraged orders, and compares it with the market balance.</p>
          <p>If the market balance is insufficient, the shortfall is funded from the free vault and wallet in the same flow, with approve, deposit and allocate added ahead of the order. All steps are listed and the funding amount must be acknowledged before signing. For an existing position, a shortfall reported by the contract preview is funded the same way.</p>

The order is sized so the <em>resulting</em> position reaches the target. On the opposite side, the order reduces toward the target and never reverses the position.</p>
          <p>Leverage sizing requires a live mark, Reduce only disabled and no open orders.</p>

            <li><strong>From the order ticket.</strong> When an order needs more collateral than the market balance holds, the ticket adds the funding transactions ahead of the order. See <Link href="/docs/orders#leverage">Leverage and funding</Link>.</li>
            <li><strong>Manually.</strong> Use <strong>Manage collateral</strong> in the Balances panel to approve, deposit and allocate a chosen amount.</li>

          <p>In both cases, free vault balance is applied before wallet balance.</p>
          <p>If a step fails, the feedback lists each confirmed step with its explorer link. A retry resumes from the free vault balance.</p>

          <p><strong>Releasable</strong> is the amount of market balance the contract permits returning to the free vault at the current block. For an account with no position and no orders, this is the full balance. For a leveraged account, release must leave the account above initial margin, including open orders, final-day backing and market coverage requirements.</p>
          <p>Release requires a fresh index price, including for flat accounts. Free vault balance can be withdrawn regardless.</p>

          <p>Returning collateral to the wallet takes two transactions: <strong>release</strong> (market to free vault) and <strong>withdraw</strong> (free vault to wallet). Keeping these separate allows collateral to remain in the vault for reallocation.</p>
