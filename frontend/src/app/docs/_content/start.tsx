        { id: "introduction", title: "Introduction", body: <>
          <p>Each Eros market is a binary question with a scheduled resolution time, for example &ldquo;Will the Golden State Warriors beat the Miami Heat on 5 November 2026?&rdquo; The YES price trades between 0 and 1 and represents the market&apos;s implied probability of the event.</p>
          <p>Traders take a <strong>long</strong> position to gain from a rising YES price or a <strong>short</strong> position to gain from a falling one. A position can be closed at any time before the market halts, or held to resolution and settled against the actual outcome. Eligible markets support leverage of up to 5×.</p>
          <p>Order matching, margin checks, the reserve that backs leverage, and settlement are all executed by contracts on Monad.</p>
        </> },
        { id: "design", title: "Design principles", body: <>
          <p>A YES claim pays 1 if the event occurs and 0 if it does not. At resolution, its price does not converge gradually: it moves to 0 or 1 in a single block. A leveraged position on the losing side cannot be liquidated in time, so its loss cannot be recovered from the trader. Eros addresses this with two rules:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Leverage is unwound before resolution.</strong> From T − 12h 30m, every account must return to full backing on a fixed schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>Residual losses are covered by a pre-funded reserve.</strong> The contracts continuously verify that the reserve can meet all deficits under both a YES and a NO outcome.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>As a result, a trader&apos;s maximum loss in a market is limited to the collateral allocated to it. Losses beyond that amount are absorbed by the reserve.</p>

      sections: [
        { id: "claims", title: "Claims", body: <>
          <p>All exposure on Eros is denominated in <strong>claims</strong>. A claim pays <strong>1 tUSDC on YES</strong> and <strong>0 on NO</strong>. If a market resolves INVALID, a claim pays a captured price between 0 and 1 (see <Link href="/docs/settlement">Settlement and claims</Link>).</p>
          <p>Because a claim pays at most 1, its price is bounded between 0 and 1 and can be read as an implied probability. Prices are quoted in increments of 0.001, from 0.001 to 0.999.</p>
        </> },
        { id: "direction", title: "Position direction", body: <>
          <p>A <strong>long</strong> position gains when the YES price rises and pays out if the event occurs. A <strong>short</strong> position gains when the YES price falls and pays out if it does not. Because the NO price is always 1 minus the YES price, NO exposure maps directly to YES exposure:</p>
          <Table rows={[
            ["Position", "Equivalent to", "Profits when"],
            ["Long YES", "Short NO", "The YES price rises, or the event occurs"],
            ["Short YES", "Long NO", "The YES price falls, or the event does not occur"],
          ]} />
          <p>Each account holds a single net position per market. A sell order against a long position reduces that position; it does not open a separate short.</p>
        </> },
        { id: "example", title: "Example", body: <>
          <p>The YES price is 0.40. A trader opens a fully backed long of 100 claims at a cost of 100 × 0.40 = <strong>40 tUSDC</strong>.</p>

            ["Held to resolution; outcome NO", "0 paid; the 40 tUSDC cost is lost"],
          ]} />
          <p>A fully backed short of 100 claims at 0.40 requires 100 × (1 − 0.40) = 60 tUSDC, which is its maximum loss if the event occurs.</p>
        </> },
        { id: "perpetual", title: "Perpetual mechanics", body: <>
          <p>A conventional perpetual future tracks an underlying price indefinitely, with periodic funding keeping it aligned with spot. Eros applies the same structure to events: the Eros book trades against an external reference price, the <strong>index</strong>, and on leveraged markets an hourly <Link href="/docs/funding">funding</Link> payment keeps the two aligned.</p>
          <p>Unlike a conventional perpetual, an event perpetual has a scheduled end. It trades as a perpetual while the question is open, then unwinds leverage and settles on the observed outcome.</p>
        </> },
        { id: "time-decay", title: "Time to resolution", body: <>
          <p>The expected total movement of an event price is independent of the time remaining. With one month remaining, that movement is distributed across a month; with one hour remaining, it is concentrated into an hour, and at resolution it occurs as a single jump.</p>
          <p>For this reason, margin requirements increase as resolution approaches, available leverage can decrease without any change in price, and all leveraged accounts must be fully backed before the final twelve hours. See <Link href="/docs/leverage">Leverage and margin</Link> and <Link href="/docs/lifecycle">Market lifecycle</Link>.</p>
